## Introduction
This post explains the basic features of django DRF's serializer.

### Serializer?
- Serializer is a handy tool / component built in the Django Rest Framework, that helps you **convert complex data** such as querysets and model instances **into python datatypes** that can then be turned into JSON or other content types. It **also allows** you to convert the **parsed data back into complex types**, after validating the data

## Getting Started

### Why do we need it?
Suppose that you have a UserProfile model looking like this
```python
class UserProfile(models.Model):
    uid = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, 
                           editable=False, unique=True)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, 
                             related_name='profiles')

    profile_name = models.CharField(null=True, max_length=30)

    bio_title = models.CharField(null=True, max_length=40)
    bio = models.CharField(null=True, max_length=155)
    
    job_title = models.CharField(null=True, max_length=40)
    job_description = models.CharField(null=True, max_length=155)

    # and perhaps some more fields
```
Now imagine creating an instance of that in views.py using the data from the request. It would look something like this
```python
# ASSUMING YOU ALREADY HAVE A 'user' object
post_data = request.data
try:
    profile_name = post_data['profile_name']
    bio_title = post_data['bio_title']
    bio = post_data['bio']
    job_title = post_data['job_title']
    job_description = post_data['job_description']
except KeyError:
    # handling error in case the post data doesn't contain certain values

# manually creating an instance
instance = UserProfile(user=user, email=email, 
                        profile_name=profile_name 
                        ...
                        )
instance.save()
```
This already looks repetitive, and an error can easily occur. **This is NOT what we want**. Which is exactlly what serializers are for.

With serializer, the code would looke like this. The serializer would help convert the python's datatypes into a complex model instance.

```python
# with serializer
instance = UserProfileSerializer(data=request.data)
if instance.is_valid():
    instance.save(user=user)
```

## Setting Up
1. Create a `serializers.py` file inside your app directory, not the project directory. e.x: `myproject/myapp/.`
2. Create a serializer component. The following is an example serialzer for the UserProfile model above.
    ```python
    # import the necessary modules
    from rest_framework import serializers
    from .models import UserProfile

    class UserProfileSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
        # you can set certain fields as read only as well
        uid = serializers.UUIDField(read_only=True)
        name = serializers.SerializerMethodField(read_only=True)
        gender = serializers.SerializerMethodField(read_only=True)
        age = serializers.SerializerMethodField(read_only=True)

        # defining the fields that the serializer is going to include
        class Meta:
            model = UserProfile
            # define the depth of relationships
            depth = 1
            fields = [   
                "uid", 
                "profile_name", 
                "bio_title",
                "bio", 
                "job_title",
                "job_description",
                
                # You can even get data from the User instance that
                # the serializer is linked to
                "name",
                "gender",
                "age", 
            ]

        def get_name(self, obj):
            # the serializer would traverse the relationship 
            # to query these data
            return obj.user.name
        def get_age(self, obj):
            return obj.user.age
        def get_gender(self, obj):
            return obj.user.gender
    ```
    `depth`
    - _The depth option should be set to an integer value that **indicates the depth of relationships** that should be traversed before reverting to a flat representation_(from official doc)
    
    `fields`
    - a list of strings that indicates which fields is included in this serializer

     `get_{field name}` functions
    - some data's cannot be directly queried, or you may want to customize the values of some fields.
    - that is when you use the functions starting with `get`. So for example, the `get_name` function in the code above reads the `name` field from the user instance that is set as foreign key to the UserProfile model, and allow us to easily access it via serialzer

## How to use
### Turning Complex Data -> Python Datatype
Let's say that you want to return the user's profile data as a response. You can use the serializer to turn the instance of an model into a dictionary, then return it using `Response`.
```python
profile = UserProfile.objects.get(uid=uid)
serializer = UserProfileSerializer(profile)
return Response(serializer.data)
```
It's that easy. It automatically converts the model instance into a dictionary, then you return that dictionary using `Response` whcih will returned the data in json format. Like below
```json
{
  "uid": "9e168432-6522-4461-aa1f-39251d7daeb5",
  "profile_name": "asdf",
  "name": "asdf",
  "gender": "asdf",
  "age": 100,
  ...  
  ...
}
```

### Turning Python Datatype -> Complex Data
Now let's turn python datatype into complex datatypes, in many cases, serializer instance itself. I explained it earlier in this post. But let's look at it in more detail.
```python
instance = UserProfileSerializer(data=request.data)
if instance.is_valid():
    instance.save(user=user)
```
In this case, the `request.data` instance is not a built-in python datatype like dictionary. However, you can turn a dictionary into a model instance in the exact same way.
```python
data = {
    "profile_name": "asdf",
    "bio": "asdf"
    ...
    ...
}

serializer = UserProfileSerializer(data=data)
if serializer.is_valid():
    user_profile = serializer.save()
```

### Other Uses
You can also use serializer for other uses, like updating an instance.
```python
# querying the outdated profile
profile = UserProfile.objects.get(uid=uid)
serializer = UserProfileSerializer(profile, data=request.data)
if serializer.is_valid():
    # changing the old data with the new data
    serializer.update(instance=profile, validated_data=request.data)
```
