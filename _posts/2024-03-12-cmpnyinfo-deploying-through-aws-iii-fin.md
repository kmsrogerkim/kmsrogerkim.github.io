### Subtitle: uploading image to ecr; deploying with ecs

## Introduction

In this post, I am going to talk about
1. uploading the docker image to ECR
2. creating cluster in ECS
3. writing task definition for my cmpnyinfo application
4. creating service & deploying with ECS

## Uploading to ECR

I am going to explain how I setup awscli in my Ubuntu WSL. This should work just fine even if you are just using Ubuntu that's not WSL.

***First,*** you have to create an user in the IAM console. Create an access key and set the policies for Public&Private registry.

***Secondly,*** type the command `sudo apt install awscli` to install awscli  
- If this give you an error, try typing: 
- `pip install 'urllib3<2'`

***Thirdly,*** type the command `aws configure`; and configure your settings accordingly.
- You can type `aws configure list` to see all the configurations of the profiles you created

***Lastly,*** copy the commands in provided by ECR when you push the `View push commands` button. It should look something like this
![](/assets/img/ecr-push-commands.jpg)

- If you facen and error, configure theÂ **~/docker/config.json** file and delete this line
```
"credStore": "desktop"
```     
- The full code would look sth like this
```
{
  "auths": {
    "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {},
    "public.ecr.aws": {
      "auth": "some-stuff
    }
  }
}
```
***Mind the comma! Make the code compiable!*** 

## Creating cluster

Now you have to create the cluster; which, as I explained, is the cluster of underlying infrastructures, such as EC2 instances, required to run your application.

There are two options for your _infrastructure_ for your cluster
1. Fargate
2. EC2

For my application, I am going to use EC2. However, I believe most people prefer fargate, due to its simplicity and extra features. So if you want to launch your application with fargate, you can go ahead and watch [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esISkPlnxL0&list=WL&index=13&t=916s).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esISkPlnxL0&list=WL&index=13&t=916s

It is so far the best tutorial I have found, so I strongly recommend you watching it!

Now you can just go to the [ecs page](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs).

https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs

### Infrastructure
And click the _"Create cluster"_ button, and choose the infrastructure type as EC2. Like this:
![](/assets/img/create-cluster1.png)
#### Configure you OS and instance type accordingly. I used Amazon Linux 2 and t2.micro(free tier) for my application

Then, modify the rest of the setting in the _"infrastructure tab"_
![](/assets/img/create-cluster2.png)
#### set the minimum capacity as 1, or else no EC2 instance will be created and your tasks will be stuck in provisioning state.
#### create a new key pair if you don't have one! choose .pem type unless you are going to use PuTTY for SSH.

### Network settings
![](/assets/img/create-cluster3.png)

If you don't have a default VPC and/or subnets, you have to create one manually. If you have no idea what they are, or how to create them, please refer to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2doSoMN2xvI&list=PL0yqfPf4QbKGmyi-8DG1GVoESHs9tiY3z&index=73&t=1365s)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2doSoMN2xvI&list=PL0yqfPf4QbKGmyi-8DG1GVoESHs9tiY3z&index=73&t=1365s

You also have to create your security group.
My security group allows 
- http request into port 80 from anywhere around the world
- SSH into port 22 from anywhere
  -  This is not recommended
  - I set it as anywhere sepcifically for this post
  - You can configure the setting so that only your IP address can access your containers.

I am not going to configure the _"monitoring"_ and the _"tags"_ tab, so go ahead and click that _"create"_ button to create your cluster.

## Create Task Definition
Now let's create our task definition

### Infrastructure requirements
![](/assets/img/create-td1.png)
- set the launch type as EC2, and EC2 only (if you are going to launch it with EC2)
- set the os accordingly
- **set the network mode to bridge!!** This will enable the containers to refer to eachother by names, when we link them together.
  - originally, if you launch with fargate, "awsvpc" network mode will automatically allow you to refer the containers by names.
  - but if you use EC2 launch type, you have to use the "bridge" mode and manually link the containers together
- set the CPU and memory accordingly
  - since we are using t2 micro, which provides 1 vCPU and 1GB of memory, we are going to set the CPU and Memory as 0.8 vCPU and 0.8 GB. Don't mind the photo!

![](/assets/img/create-td2.png)
- set the name and the URI to the image in your ECR accordingly
- this container is the django container, so it will listen on port 8000
- set the CPU and Memory accordingly
  - **CPU should be 0.35 vCPU! NOT 0.45!**
- you should also set your environmental variables. Variables such as `SECRET_KEY` or `DEBUG` should be set as environmental variable

![](/assets/img/create-td3.png)
- Now let's define the nginx container
- This container is listening on port 80
- set the CPU and Memory accordingly
  - **CPU should be 0.35 vCPU! NOT 0.45!**

![](/assets/img/create-td4.png)
- startup dependency
  - just like we did in the docker-compose file, we are going to set the nginx container dependent to the dj-gunicorn container
- Container network
  - since we are using the _"bridge"_ network mode, we have to link the containers.

## Create service

Since we have created our task definition, now we have to deploy it to the cluster through ECS!

1. Go to the _"Cluster"_ tab and select the cluster you've created, then go to the _"Service"_ and click _"Create"_

![](/assets/img/create-service1.png)
- select Launch type and EC2

![](/assets/img/create-service2.png)
- set the family as the task definition you've created (for me is cmpnyinfo-td )
- set the desired tasks to 1

## Finishing

Now that's basically it! Now click _"create"_ and pray that your service deploys just fine; which, ***barely happens.*** Here are some recommendations for you when you face error

### When you're stuck in provisioning state
- make sure that in the _"infrastructure"_ tab in the cluster, there's one or more EC2 instances running
- If you don't see any instances, make sure that you set the minimum capacity as 1 when you created the cluster
- If you still couldn't get out of the provisioning state, GOOD LUCK. Don't give up. If you think you've got enough of it, just use fargate to launch

### When the containers fail, or is in "stopped" state
- enable log checking when you create your task definition
- chekc the log and, GOOD LUCK!

### Other problems
- **Insufficient CPU/Memory**: reduce the CPU and Memory in the task definition
- **Other**: GOOD LUCK. Try your best not to question your entire career!! We all go through this phase!
