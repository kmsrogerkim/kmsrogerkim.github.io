## Introduction

In this post, I am going to talk about
- creating html&css templates in django for my website

## The File Structure
Before we dig in, I want to explain the file structure of my django project. My project consists of largely two seperate application.
- ***The UI***
    - Takes care of the html pages and user inputs
    - All the html pages are in the UI application,
- ***The API***
    - Uses _djangorestframework_ to get http requests from the UI application, 
    - then returns certain values, like yesterday's stock price of the given company and etc.

Here's a diagram to help you understand.
```
the root django dir
    - cmpnyinfo (project config for django)
    - static (images and css)
    - UI
        - templates
            - home.html
            - blach.html
            .
            .
            .
    - API
```

## The home.html
Here's how my home page looks like right now.

How does it look? Yeah I know. It's not really the best looking website out there. But it works just fine.

So, while I am developing web-pages in django, I noticed some of it's unique features. Here's what I mean by ***django's unique features***
- handling static files (img&css etc)
- loading other html files (e.x: navbar)
- passing variables to the front-end
- csfr token

If you are interested in the things above, I wrote a post about it [here](https://kmsrogerkim.github.io/django/django-html-features/)

## The cmpny.html
This page is for displaying the information of the company the user typed in the search bar.

The page is not complete yet. The contents in the boxes will change. I am planning to include
- Different types of graphs, which will be placed in the third box, _seperated by tabs_.
- Summary of the company's financial statement (Operating income & etc) over the past few years.


***Usage of Language***

But there's a slight problem that's bothering me. THE LANGUAGE. The companies that the website support, are Korean corporations. Their names are in Korean. But everyting else is in English.

So I am planning to give each corporation an English name. I will try to look for a smart way to do it, but if I can't, I will probably just have to add all 100s of them one by one.

***Expected Issue***

Here's a veyr plossible scenario. The user enters _"samsung"_ in the search bar, but nothing shows up. Because _"samsung"_ is not listed in the Korean Composite Stock Price Index!(KOSPI). _"Samsung Electronics"_ is. It's like _"Google"_ and _"Alphabet Inc."_

I will have to look for ways to solve that issue, as well.
