## Introduction 
As a part of a group study session at my college's artificial intelligence club [HYU HAI](https://github.com/HanyangTechAI), I came across Dr. J. Ho's _Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models_. We studied the paper together, and here's what I learned from it.
- Forward & Reverse Process
- How Neural Network is used to in the reverse process

## Forwarding Process
Forwarding process is the process of adding noise to an image. It is also called diffusion process. Let the original image be represented by X0. The forward process if defined as
q(Xt+1 | Xt)
But, it can be re-written thanks to this paper, in terms of 
q(Xt | whatever)
Notice how it is now just t. Not t+1. Now we can add noise at once, without having to actually go through all the steps.

## Reverse Process
Now, the goal of this paper is to denoise that Xt image back into X0. In order to do that, a reverse process is defined as follow.
p(Xt-1 | Xt)
and blah
parameter blah blah

## The NN comes in
So in order to prediect and calculate the value, we use Neural Netwoks. Since it is pattern, we can learn and predict it.

## Insights
Diffusion Model is used every where.
