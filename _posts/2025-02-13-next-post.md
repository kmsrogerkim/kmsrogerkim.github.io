## Introduction 
As a part of a group study session at my college's artificial intelligence club([HYU HAI](https://github.com/HanyangTechAI)), I came across THE _Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models_. We studied the paper together, trying to understand the content; and here's what I got.
- How markov chain is used to add noise to an image
- How Neural Network is used the denoise the image
